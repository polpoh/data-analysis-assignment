# Data Analysis with Pandas and Visualization with Matplotlib

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project demonstrates how to **load, clean, analyze, and visualize data** using Python libraries:
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** (and Seaborn) for creating visualizations.

The dataset used in this project is the **Iris dataset** (saved as `database.csv`).

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Load and explore a dataset using Pandas.
- Perform basic statistical analysis.
- Group and summarize data based on categories.
- Create visualizations to better understand the data.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files in This Project
- `assignment.ipynb` â†’ Jupyter Notebook with all the analysis and visualizations.  
- `database.csv` â†’ Dataset (Iris dataset).  
- `README.md` â†’ This file, explaining the project.  

---

## ðŸ”Ž Analysis Steps
1. **Load and Explore the Dataset**
   - Loaded the Iris dataset from `database.csv`.
   - Checked for missing values and data types.
   - Cleaned data where necessary.

2. **Basic Data Analysis**
   - Used `.describe()` for statistical summaries.
   - Computed mean, median, and standard deviation.
   - Grouped data by species and calculated averages.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - **Line chart** showing trends over index.
   - **Bar chart** comparing average petal length per species.
   - **Histogram** showing distribution of sepal lengths.
   - **Scatter plot** comparing sepal length vs. petal length.

## ðŸ“Š Tools and Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (for loading the Iris dataset originally)

---

## âœ… Findings
- Each Iris species shows distinct patterns in petal and sepal measurements.  
- Petal length is the strongest feature for distinguishing species.  
- Data is clean with no missing values in this dataset.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone or download this project folder.  
2. Open `assignment.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook (or Google Colab).  
3. Ensure `database.csv` is in the same folder.  
4. Run all the notebook cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
